It's a data storytelling dashboard made using tableau and embed on a single html page.

On this page we made a simple data analytics using combined tourism data from BPS-Statistics and national holiday data that scrapped from various website.
In this project we aim to deliver what we found in those data. We tried to find any correlation in the Indonesian's Government Policy about increasing the nationals holiday with the intention of increasing the inbound of local tourist (they hope to increase foreigners too).
What we found is, there is not enough statistical proof that increasing the nationals holiday is correlated to the increase of tourist (locals or foreigner) visits.
